"With `echo` I talk," means that you can use the UNIX `echo` tool to send text to standard output, so, you are "talking" to the computer.

"And with `echo` I walk," is referring to the fact that, using the UNIX pipe, you can start command chains with `echo`, and thus with these command chains you are "walking" the "computer wayz" (wayz with a 'z' to be a little bit gangsta).

"My best days." is a statement to the love and joy that one can get from using the computer. I think this is pretty much self-explanatory.
